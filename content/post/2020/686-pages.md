*Rubenerd* is up to 686 pages, which is a palindromic number. I took great pains to only mention the number, as the phrase itself isn't palindromic in English. Delightfully though, *segap* means good in Malay (IIRC), so I like to think someone up there thinks reaching that number was a positive thing. 

The next time this will happen, and the last time before 700, is 696. I can see those years of university discrete mathematics *set* me up well. That was a quality pun.
