<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">15:00</span> – My tribute to people who have died in war in light of the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month which happened last Friday, why there is no justification for war, why we are the most efficient killing machines and playing the Australian National Anthem. In other topics discussing extreme weather around the world including the localised floods and extreme temperature variations that have swept Adelaide this week, my lack of energy and what the doctor found out what the cause was after I took a blood test, beakers full of salt and electrical current, and university exams and exam deferrals.</p>
